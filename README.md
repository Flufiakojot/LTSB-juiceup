### What does this script do?
This batch script will disable some services and limit the telemetry to improve privacy and gain performance on lower-end hardware!
It also removes OneDrive.


### Compatibility
I have made this script in mind for the LTSB 2016 (1609), which is already without bloat. It might not work or do its job properly on newer versions.
