# LTSB-juiceup
## Limit telemetry and improve performance on lower-end hardware!


### What does this sript do?
This script will disable some services and limit the telemetry to improve privacy and gain performance on lower-end hardware!


## Compatibility
I have made this script in mind for the LTSB 2016 (1609), which is already without bloat. It might not work or do its job properly on newer versions.
